# About
This is a small project for gaining a better understanding of the kinematics behind robot arms. It specifically will be used for learning the product of exponentials formulation for representing the coordinates of a robot arm.

The code is tested using the [ViperX-300](https://docs.trossenrobotics.com/interbotix_xsarms_docs/specifications/vx300s.html) by Trossen Robotics. The arm is visually represented in MuJoCo, where the model is loaded from the [mujoco_menagerie repository](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_menagerie).
